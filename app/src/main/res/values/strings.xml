    <string name="article_text">Article text\n
        In the previous task you created the Scrolling Text app with TextViews for an article title,\n
        subtitle, and lengthy article text.\n
        You also included a web link, but the link is not yet active.\n
        You will add the code to make it active.\n
        Also, the TextView by itself can\'t enable users to scroll the article text to see all of it.\n
        You will add a new view group called ScrollView to the XML layout that will make the TextView scrollable.\n
        Choose Code > Reformat Code to reformat the XML code so that the article TextView now appears indented inside the code.
            Run the app.\n
        \n
            Swipe up and down to scroll the article. The scroll bar appears in the right margin as you scroll.\n
            Tap the web link to go to the web page.\n
        \n
        The android:autoLink attribute turns any recognizable URL in the TextView (such as www.rockument.com) into a web link.\n
Rotate your device or emulator while running the app. \n
        \n
        Notice how the scrolling view widens to use the full display and still scrolls properly.\n
Run the app on a tablet or tablet emulator.\n
        \n
        Notice how the scrolling view widens to use the full display and still scrolls properly.</string>
